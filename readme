In this project, we will make a Bidirectional Visitor Counter with an Automatic Light Control System using Arduino. This project is based on a pair of Infrared Sensor that detects interrupt when it detects an obstacle. The pair of IR sensors can detect the visitor from both directions, i.e. the number of entering visitors and the number of exiting visitors.

This Arduino Bidirectional Visitor Counter Project can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall, Shopping mall, office, functions in the entrance gate. It can also be used at gates of parking areas and other public places. The device counts the total number of people entering through the gate and also the total number of people leaving through the same gate. And finally, it counts the total number of people currently present inside the room. When no people are inside the room, i.e. the total number of people is zero then the room light is turned off. When even a single person is found inside the room, the light turns on. The light control system is automatic based on the visitors’ presence.

We can make the entire project using a single Arduino Nano Board. We can use a 16x2 LCD Display to show the number of visitors. But you can prefer a 0.96″ OLED Display for the project. A 5V Single channel relay gets activated when a person is detected inside a room. The light turns ON automatically which is connected to the Relay.
